PROMPT
Think about everything you know about your Praxis cohort (the icebreakers doc is fair game). Think about the kind of questions that might interest you about such a corpus and the best way to structure that information to answer those questions. Write some Python code in the vein of the Scholars Lab example in the data structures review that represents the model you come up with. This one is intentionally a bit amorphous, but any practice in thinking about the shape of data is useful.
